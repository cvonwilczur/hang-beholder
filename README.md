Welcome to Hangmage, my spin on the classic word-guessing game Hangman.

### The Plot

Wizard! Your sorcery has never been so crucial as it is now; time has slowed to mere seconds as the portal before you tears away reality, revealing the unknowable infinities of the Far Realms. Thoughts of your party-members fade away as eye-stalks begin to materialize through the portal-- the most dangerous of aberrations is beginning to emerge. You will need to counterspell the necromancer's summoning ritual by guessing the glyphs used in assembling the final spell! Quickly now, for you'll only have six tries before the Beholder enters the material plane and devours us all!
